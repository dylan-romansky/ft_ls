I am currently adding further functionality on my own time, however as it stands this is a completed project. It currently supports "-AFGHRadfghlortu1" flags and column formatting (though that's not perfect). The intended goal of this project was just to familiarize us with how unix manages directories and their contents, giving us hands-on experience with the "everything is a file" philosophy and the resulting tools and data structures available to us in a C environment. While the main goal of the project was the aforementioned data structures and handling, it also forced us to come up with a few simple, basic algorithms to handle the different aspects of flag parsing/executing the associated options as well as made us really dig into some very technical documentation to understand how to properly work with the aforementioned data structures.
